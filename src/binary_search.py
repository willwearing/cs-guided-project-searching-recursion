# Binary Search 
​
# [4, 6, 5, 1, 8, 9] - Best we can we is O(n) for searching
# since there's no order to the order of the elements
​
# [1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9] - If our input is sorted, we have 
# more information about the input that we can leverage 
# Target = 8
​
# [1, 4, 5, { 6, 8, 9 }]
          
# How many comparisons did we actually do? 2 
​
# 1. We want to narrow down the possible range of 
#    where our target must exist in the sorted array 
# 2. With each comparison, the idea is that we split 
#    the range in half.
# 3. Find the midpoint index of the current range
# 4. Compare the element at the midpoint index against 
#    the target
# 5. Depending on the result of the comparison:
#        - the midpoint element is our target 
#        - the midpoint element < target 
#        - the midpoint element > target 
​
# Since we're cutting the range in half on each 
# iteration, the runtime is logarithmic
